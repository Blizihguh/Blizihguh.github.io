	<summary>Memories Are Tmporary</summary>
	<p>The cryptic crossword is composed of the names of CS@RIT machines that students can SSH into:<br/>1. BUDDY, 2. YES, 3. GLADOS, 4. ACHILLES, 5. POLICE<br/>
	In the /tmp/ directory on each of these machines is a file named CS-PUZZLE-HUNT-CLUE. Four of them are .py files with part of a python program; one of them is a .bin file with some data in it. Constructing the python program from its constitutent parts and running it in the same folder as the .bin file will output the puzzle’s answer, GOALIE.</p>

	<summary>What Are Birds?</summary>
	<p>Each image is of a bird from a different scientific family. Putting the first letter of each family name together spells out the puzzle’s answer, SCRAPER. The birds in question are a Penguin (Spheniscidae), a Luzon Bleeding Heart Dove (Columbidae), a Painted Snipe (Rostratulidae), a Yellow Crowned Night Heron (Ardeidae), a Golden Pheasant (Phasianidae), a Gouldian Finch (Estrildidae), and an Australasian Swamphen (Rallidae).</p>

	<summary>Nikoli Nonsense</summary>
	<p>Three of the puzzles are visibly broken. Solving the Herugolf will result in a series of arrows which, when overlaid over the Satogaeri grid, will show you where to move the circles in order to create a solvable puzzle. Solving the fixed Satogaeri will result in a series of arrows which, when overlaid over the Shirokuro grid, will show you where to move the circles in order to create a solvable puzzle. Solving the fixed Shirokuro will… you get the idea. The final puzzle is a Thermo-Sudoku, with certain tiles marked. When the puzzle is solved, those tiles will be filled with the numbers 613145, which correspond to the letters of the alphabet F, A, C, A, D, and E, corresponding to the puzzle’s answer, FACADE.</p>

	<summary>Musical Mayhem</summary>
	<p>The puzzle shows six pieces of musical notation, corresponding respectively to the shamisen, harmonica, guitar, ocarina, banjo, and lute. Five of them display a single note, with the guitar tab showing a chord that is named for a single note. Respectively, the notes are D, G, E, G, C, and G. Take the corresponding letter of the alphabet for each (ie, 4, 7, 5, 7, 3, and 7) and the first letter of their instrument. Shift the instrument letter that many letters forward to get the answer, WOLVES.</p>

	<summary>It's All Latin To Me</summary>
	<p>Each row contains a clue corresponding to a word in two languages: Latin, and Pig Latin(!). From top to bottom, the latin words are AMPLA(Y), AVORSA(Y), INERMA(Y), ARTA(Y), ARCA(Y), and ILIACA(Y), corresponding to the English words LAMP, SAVOR, MINER, TAR, CAR, and CILIA. Taking the highlighted letters gives the answer, PORTAL.</p>

	<summary>Nerd Search</summary>
	<p>The word search contains the names of several pioneers in computer science and mathematics. Once all of these names are highlighted, the remaining space in the grid spells the message, “RUN CONWAYS GAME OF LIFE FOR SIXTY GENERATIONS WITH CELLS AT THE VOWELS”. Doing this results in a grid where the only living cells are over letters corresponding to the letters in the word TUNISIA, which is the answer. The nerds in question are Babbage, Boole, Lovelace, Russell, Godel, Church, Turing, Shannon, Neumann, Hopper, Chomsky, Dijkstra, Stallman, Stoustrup, Berners-Lee, Torvalds, Knuth, Minsky, and Hamming.</p>

	<summary>More Nikoli Nonsense</summary>
	<p>The puzzle is a 26x26 nonogram (picross) puzzle. Some of the numbers in the clues have been replaced with letters. It is possible to determine what numbers have been replaced by using the other constraints in the puzzle. The solution to the nonogram is a picture of toilet paper. The replaced clues correspond to the letters of the words “toilet paper:” for instance, the clue replaced by A is 8, and the 8th letter of “toilet paper” is an A. The clue replaced by B is 3, and the 3rd letter of “toilet paper” is I. Following this process for all of the removed clues results in the solution, AIRPORT.</p>

	<summary>RIT Recollections</summary>
	<p>Each clue in the puzzle corresponds to an RIT building in two ways: it describes the building literally, and contains the three-letter acronym corresponding to the building’s name. Respectively, the buildings are Lowenthal (LOW), Sustainability Institute (SUS), Grace Watson (GWH), Carson (CAR), Schmitt Interfaith Center (SMT), and the Student Activities Union (SAU). Taking the sum of the first three (the ones with +s next to them) and subtracting the last three (the ones with -s) results in the building number for Polisseni, leading to the solution, HOCKEY.</p>

	<summary>Metapuzzle</summary>
	<p>There is only one way to lay the eight puzzle solutions into the grid such that the dashed lines mark words with the same letter in each word. From top to bottom, the words are TUNISIA, WOLVES, GOALIE, FACADE, PORTAL, AIRPORT, HOCKEY, and SCRAPER. When filled out, the highlighted cells correspond to IATA airport codes: Red is WAT, Orange is CPH, Yellow is GOA, Green is LCA, Cyan is IOA, Blue is SVO, Purple is AEY, and Magenta is LIS. Each of these airports is marked on the map. Drawing lines from each of these eight airports to the other seven results in a map in which every country is intersected by at least one line, with the exception of LATVIA, which is the final solution to the hunt.</p>

	<summary>Bonus Puzzle</summary>
	<p>Warning: I am not an expert in chess or musical transcription. I may have some stuff wrong here. That being said... the solutions to the individual puzzles are:<br/>1. E4 E4 2. E5<br/>1. H4 B4 2. A4<br/>1. G4<br/>1. E4 G4 2. A4<br/>Each of these corresponds to a musical note (using the German notation convention that B = H, and B flat = B). Together, these form the opening notes to Megalovania. It seems that you were playing against SANS.</p>
