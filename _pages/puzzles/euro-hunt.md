This is a puzzle hunt that some friends and I made for a class we took. Created in April of 2020, it concerns the main thing that happened in April of 2020. To wit:

You were having a wonderful time in Europe, enjoying your nice rest after a long day of sightseeing, when all of a sudden, you received a ton of calls from your family. It turns out travel to and from Europe was banned... Well, now you must rush home at 3 A.M. before itâ€™s too late.

<script>
	function hashCode(str) {
	    let hash = 0;
	    for (let i = 0, len = str.length; i < len; i++) {
	        	let chr = str.charCodeAt(i);
	        	hash = (hash << 5) - hash + chr;
	        	hash |= 0; // Convert to 32bit integer
	    	}
	    	return hash;
	}

	function check() {
		let guess = document.getElementById("answerBox").value.toUpperCase();
		let result = hashCode(guess);
		var answers = {
			2107639663: "Memories Are Tmporary",
			"-1650708450": "What Are Birds?",
			2066130074: "Nikoli Nonsense",

<em>Unfortunately, the second half of this puzzle relies on you having access to RIT's CS lab servers, which is probably not the case, statistically speaking. Also, it relies on some files I put in the temp directories on those servers still being there, which is also unlikely. So, even though it was the coolest part of the puzzle, you'll have to skip it. Once you've solved the crossword, you can find the rest of the puzzle <a href="/downloads/euro-puz-hunt/">here</a>.
