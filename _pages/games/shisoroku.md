WARNING: All code on this page is a work-in-progress; I do not guarantee that it won't break in the future due to updates to dominion.games or Firefox (or any other browser, for that matter).

In 2020, I made a browser extension to replace the card art on dominion.games with the art from Touhou Shisoroku, an official Dominion reskin made by Hobby Japan. The game has been out of print for years now, and finding copies is both hard and expensive, even if you live in Japan. This extension seeks to provide a way for people to play the game without having to pay in the hundreds of thousands of yen for it. As a bonus, since the extension is designed around an official online implementation, you can support Dominion while you do it! The extension and assets can be found in its Github repository, for use on Dominion.games and in other projects.
