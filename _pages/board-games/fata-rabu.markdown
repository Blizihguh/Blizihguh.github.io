<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/303310/The_House_in_Fata_Morgana/">The House in Fata Morgana</a> is the greatest visual novel of all time. If you haven't played it, you should play it; if you have played it, you should probably play it again. But when you're not busy playing it, you can instead play this Love Letter reskin based on it! 

<a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter">Love Letter</a> is a classic card game for 2-4 players. It's good, simple fun, light enough to play with your kids (or parents), but with enough gameplay to be engaging time and time again. Just like Fata Morgana\*! What's more, Love Letter has about a hundred official and unofficial reskins. When you think about it like that, the Fata Morgana pairing seems almost inevitable!
