Mayor McMott is an extensible board game emulator for Discord. Also known as MottBot, after the bot account that I host it under, Mayor McMott is capable of running board games for you and your friends to play anywhere, without the need for physical proximity or expensive components! Mayor McMott comes with lots of games pre-installed, and adding new games is as simple as writing a few lua functions.
